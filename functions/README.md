# Functions

In this lab you will learn:

- What is a function
- Why programmers use functions
- How to write your own functions in C

## What is a Function?

**Functions** in computer science are similar to those we've seen in math, whereby they take in some input and produce some output.

Since the first program we wrote together, we've been using functions! These were functions that were given to us, that we didn't have to create ourselves, such as `printf()`, `get_int()`, and even `main()`.

These functions were written by programmers many years ago, and are made available to us so we don't have to constantly reinvent the wheel! We are able to reuse these functions over and over again. 

Imagine what programming would be like if we had to recreate `printf()` every time we wanted to output something to our terminal window! It would take forever to complete the simplest program!

The other key reason that programmers use functions is **abstraction**. To use `get_int()` for instance, we need to know
* The name of the function
* What the function does
* What arguments to give to the function
* What kind of result the function returns

In order to use `get_int()`, we don't have to know how it's implemented. We only need to know how to use it.

## Writing our own Functions

We can write our own functions as well! Once we've taken the time to program and debug our function, we can use it over and over again in multiple programs. Using functions, our code becomes simpler, more organized, and easier to debug!

Every C program that we've written so far contains one function, the `main` function. We can define our own custom functions with similar syntax.

In order to use our own custom function, we need to give the compiler information about the function. We do this with a function **prototype**, above the `main` function. 

The prototype contains three parts: 

1. The **return type**, which is the data type of the function's output. The return type of the `get_int()` function, for instance, is an `int`. Sometimes a function does not return a value, (such as `printf()`), in which case the return type is `void`.
2. The name; this cannot include spaces and cannot be one of C's existing keywords.
3. The parameters, in parentheses, also known as **arguments**. These are the function's inputs (if there are none, use `void`). The data type of each argument must be included in front of the argument name.

The function definition, includes the logic that will be carried out, which is enclosed in curly braces. The function definition typically follows the main function. Note that the function prototype is followed by a semicolon, `;`, while the function definition is not.

{% next %}

Let's take a look at this example:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int square(int n);  //function prototype, aka declaration

int main(void)
{
    int side = get_int("Enter the side length: ");
    printf("The area is %i.\n", square(side));   //square(side) is the function call
}

//function definition
int square(int n)
{
    return n * n;
}
```

We've created a custom function named `square()`. We declare the function with the return type `int`, the name, `square`, and the argument with its type, `(int n)`. Our `main()` function calls the `square()` function when printing the square of the input. We call the function using its name ,`square`, with the value we are passing into that function ,`side`. The previous line of code declares and gets a value for `side`, so this variable is already initialized.

When the function runs, the value that is passed when it's called (stored in `side`) is copied into the variable defined as an input to the function (`n`). We now calculate the square and return its value, which is an `int` since the function was declared with an `int` return value.

Note that our function, `square()`, is defined after the `main()` function. Placing our function prototype before `main()`, allows the compiler recognize it before `main()` calls it.

Feel free to try typing this code into a new file, compiling it, and testing it.

## Your Turn

### Part 1: Create a function called get_positive_int

Now you will create a custom function `get_positive_int()`, that should take as input a prompt from the user and should output the positive integer, once the user has complied. You may want to use functions we've already used, such as `get_int()`, in your implementation.

The code is already started, with a function prototype already done. However the function itself, always returns a 0, which is not a positive number.

So the return type ,`int`, the function name, `get_positive_int`, and the input argument ,`prompt`, which has a `string` datatype, are already defined for you. Your job is to implement the function so that it continues to prompt the user until they provide a positive integer.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}
Think back to the lab where you used a loop to validate user input. Can using a do while loop work here?
{% endspoiler %}

Try to get the function to do one thing at a time. Perhaps get a loop working without a `prompt` first, that only accepts positive numbers. Then try to add the `prompt`.

{% spoiler "Hint for using `prompt`" %}

If you wish to use `get_int()`, using `prompt` directly inside the parentheses won't work. This is because the input for `get_int()` works like a `printf()` statement, where we use placeholder for variables. So you may need to syntax something like

```
result = get_int("%s", prompt);
```

to use the parameter with `get_int()`.

{% endspoiler %}

If you are really stuck, try to write some pseudocode first.

{% spoiler "Need help with the pseudocode?" %}

1. Declare a new variable to store the user input.
2. Get a value from the user and store in your new variable.
3. Check to see if the value of this variable is less than or equal to zero.
    1. If it is, go back to step 2.
4. Return the value that we know now is a positive number.


{% endspoiler %}

Compile and run your code and make sure it works before proceeding.

{% next %}

### Part 2: Create a function called get_negative_int

In C you can add as many custom functions as you'd like to your code. Let's try that by adding a second function `get_negative_int()`. Using this same file, add a second function following the same format as `get_positive_int()` only this time you want to make sure the user enters a negative number. Here are the things you'll need to do:
1. Using the existing prototype on line 4, create a new one for `get_negative_int()`
2. Using the existing `get_positive_int()` function definition as a template, create a new function called `get_negative_int()` using the same function argument `string prompt`. Make sure to modify the name and make it so it returns a negative number and not a positive number.
3. In your main function, prompt the user for a negative number, and then print that back, just like you did for `get_positive_int()`.

Got it? Let's do one final problem!

{% next %}

### Part 3: Create a function that adds the sum of two squared numbers

This problems requires you to write more in the function's definition than before. Create a new file named **functions2.c**. Copy this starter code into that file:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

//Function Prototype to tell compiler function exists 
long squared_sums(int a, int b);

int main (void)
{
  //Prompt user to enter two numbers
  
  
  
  //Call the squared_sums function with those numbers as arguments
  //Remember, the function should return a valeue, so you'll need a variable 
  //to store that in.
  
  
  
  //Print the result
  
  
}

//Function definition
long squared_sums(int a, int b)
{
  int total;
  
  //Square int a and square int b
  
  
  //Add them together and store in a variable called total
  
  
  return total;
  
}
```

Now, using this starter code, complete the custom function that computes the sum of the squares of two numbers, i.e a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>. Prompt the user to enter two numbers (one at a time), then send those two numbers to the custom function. You could say you are "calling this function with two integer arguments". The function should square each number, add them together, and return that total to your main program.

Make sure to test your program with different numbers.

Got it? Great! You can complete the optional part 4 in the next step, or continue straight to submitting your work.

### Part 4: Debugging

The below program has syntax bugs in it. Syntax bugs mean the code wasn't written according to the rules of C (incorrect semicolons, brackets, etc). Create a new file called **functions3.c** and copy the the below code into it.

1. Find and fix all the bugs so that the code compiles and runs. Feel free to look at other code examples.
2. Using comments, identify the function prototype AND function definition.



```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include cs50.h

convert_to_Fahrenheit(float a)          
 
int main()
{
    float temp = get_float("Enter a temp in C: ");
    temp = convert_to_Fahrenheit(temp);
    printf("Your temp in F is: %.2f\n", temp); 
}

float convert_to_Fahrenheit( someTemp )
{
    float newTemp;
    newTemp = 9 * someTemp / 5 + 32;
    
}
```

### Part 5 (optional): Find the Hypotenuse 

#### This part is optional! You can press next below to submit your work on problems 1-4.

Did you notice how the last problem computed the sum of two sides of a triangle? Let's finish it off by computing c in Pythagorean's Theorem, a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. All that is left is to take the square root of total from the last problem. To complete part 5:

1. Create a new file called **functions4.c**
2. Copy the code from functions2.c into functions3.c
3. Modify your function defintion and prototype so that it computes c, given a and b from the user.
4. You'll need to figure out how to [calculate the square root on your own](https://manual.cs50.io/)
5. Don't forget to check the function return type...

## Style

Since we want to get into good habits early, check that your indentation, and spacing is correct, by typing:

```
style50 functions.c
style50 functions2.c
style50 functions3.c
(optionally) style50 functions4.c 
```

It's good to get into good habits now, so when you start writing longer and more complex programs, you will know how to style your code properly. Code that is properly styled, is much easier to debug!

## How to Submit

To submit your code, execute:

```
submit50 marinacademycs/cs50labs/2020/functions
```

Your submission should be graded for corretness and style withing a few minutes on [the me50 course page](https://submit.cs50.io/)
